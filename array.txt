#arrays
linear ds used to store multiple data of same type in contigous memeory locartion

1.normal array-> it has data of same type stored as it is java , c 
disadvantage-> homogenous
2.referential array-> it stored memeory address instead of data python 
disadvantage-> extra memeory, speed slower
3.dynamic array-> adjusts according to data , no fixed size
creates array of double size when previous array gets full and copies data of previous array 
to the new array 
pythons lists are dynamic array

to prove python lists are dynamic array :
import sys
l=[]
sys.getsizeof(L)
L.append('k')
sys.getsizeof(L)
repeat this

PYTHON DOES +8 INSTEAD OF DOUBLING AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY
