#time - techniques
->measure time( import time - start time - end time)
problem is different time different hardware , small input dont work,diffent input different time
->count operations(count number of operations)
solved hardware problem and different input diffent time 
what operation to use problems

->absract order of growth
we want to evaluate programs efficiency when input is very big 
want to express growth of programs runtime as input size grows 
we want upper bound of time as tight as possible

suppose we are searching for element in an array 
best case - found at index 0
worst case - found at last
average case - found at middle

questions:
n2 + 2n + 2-> n2
n2+100000+3^10000-> n2
logn + n +2 -> n
nlogn +300n -> nlogn
2n^30 = 3^n->3^n

types of order of growth:
-> constant
-> linear
-> quadratic
-> lograthmic
-> nlogn
-> exponential 

best : c > lograthmic > linear > nlogn > n^2 > 2^n
