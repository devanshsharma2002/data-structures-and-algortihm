#data structure 
data structure is a particular way of organising data ina computers memeory 
so that it can be used effectively by program code

#algorithms
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problemsolving operaitonss
especially by computers
->purpose
->solution
->program

properties:
->INPUT(OPTIONAL- EG. LIKE A PRINT function)
->OUTPUT
->DEFITENESS
->FINITENESS

#pseudoCODE
pseudocode is a plain language code describing steps in an algorithm
it is human readable rather than machine
no broad standard for pseudocode exists
 
 pseudoCODE:
 take 2 nums
 c<-a+b
 print c

 source code:
 input(a)
 input(b)
 print (a+b)
DO NOT INSERT ANY PROGRAMMING CONCEPT IN THIS
example: 
FIND MAX NUM IN 2 nums MAX(a,b)
1.input int A
2.input int B
3.compare a>B
if true max =a , else B

#flowchart
a flowchart is diammetric representation of an algorithm
it is human readable instead of machine readable
